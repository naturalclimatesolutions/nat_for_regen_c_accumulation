# Overview
This repo contains contains code used for derivation of the Chapman Richards (CR) growth curve parameters for the manuscript entitled ***Protect young secondary forests for optimum carbon removal***. This manuscript is currently in review at Nature Climate Change. The article link and DOI will be made available on publication.

# System Requirements
## Hardware requirements
Running the Google Earth Engine code requires access to the Google Earth Engine Java Script code editor and proper authentification via a Google Cloud Project. *Note that access to much of the inventory data is restricted, and we are not able to share this data, and therefor running the GEE code is not possible without data access permissions.

Running the R demo code requires a standard computer with enough RAM to process the in memory requirements.

## Software Requirements
### OS Requirements
This source code should work on any system that can run R Statistics. The code has been tested on the following systems:

+ macOS running on either Intel and ARM processers: 
  + Sequoia (10.15 +)
  + Mojave (10.14 +)

+ Windows 10
+ Windows 11
